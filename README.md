 <!--- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
# About the project
This is my attempt at building a chess game that allows a user to play against another user in a  pass and play style or
against a engine using a deep learning neural network for my A level computing NEA.

## Built with
this project utilises the following technologies:

# Getting started
instructions here on how to get started with the project either through the web or loaclly 

# Installation
the `requirements.txt` should first be installed to ensure that all the dependencies are met

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then the `main.py` or `main.exec` file can be run to start the game

# Web Demo
You can try the chess game directly in your web browser 

## Play Online
[Click here to play the chess game in your browser](https://isaackorda.github.io/CompSci_IK/)

## Building the Web Demo Locally
If you want to build and run the web demo locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have installed all the requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pygbag
   ```

2. Run the build script:
   ```
   python build_web_demo.py
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Build the web demo using Pygbag
   - Start a local web server
   - Open your default browser to play the game

3. Additional options:
   ```
   python build_web_demo.py --help
   ```
   
   - `--port PORT`: Specify a different port (default: 8000)
   - `--no-browser`: Don't open the browser automatically
   - `--build-only`: Only build the web demo, don't run it

## Controls
- Click on a piece to select it
- Click on a highlighted square to move the piece
- Press 'T' to change the theme
- Press 'R' to reset the game


# Usage
I don't mid how you use this as it was made for fun and for my A level computing project and Summer of making
Coding should be accessible and open so if my work is of help to you then all i ask is that you credit me in your work
